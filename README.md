# tmpl

Template automation for the less exciting parts of setting up new projects or re-typing the same thing over and over.

Heavily inspired by [boilr](https://github.com/tmrts/boilr). 

The two projects share many similarities, however other than general layout/structure the implementation is entirely my own.
